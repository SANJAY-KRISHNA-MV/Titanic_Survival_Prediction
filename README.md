# Titanic Survival Prediction
![Titanic Survival Prediction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Masterx-AI/Project_Titanic_Survival_Prediction_/main/titanic.jpg)
This project implements a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on historical data.

### Project Goals

* Explore and analyze the Titanic dataset.
* Preprocess and clean the data for machine learning.
* Train and evaluate different machine learning models for predicting passenger survival.
* Gain insights into factors that influenced survival rates.

### Data

The project uses the Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset]] dataset containing information about passengers on the Titanic voyage.

### Methodology

* Data Loading and Exploration:
  - Load the dataset using pandas.
  - Explore and analyze the data to understand its characteristics and identify potential issues.

* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
  - Handle missing values using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation, mean, mode).
  - Create new features based on domain knowledge or feature engineering techniques.
  - Encode categorical features for machine learning models.

* Model Training and Evaluation:
  - Train different machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) on the preprocessed data.
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
  - Select the best performing model based on evaluation results.

* Analysis and Insights:
  - Analyze the importance of different features in the model's predictions.
  - Draw conclusions about factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic.

### Project Structure
  * data: Contains the Titanic dataset (if applicable).
  * notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and model training (if applicable).
